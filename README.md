# python-newsfeed

## A user based site using Python and SqlAlchemy on a Sql database to create ObjectRelationalMapping of data.  Importing the PIP package Flask to create routes specific to data either being presented, created, updated, or deleted.  Utilizing SqlAlchemy's context method for protecting/remembering that ORM of data so that the context stays the same until another call is made.  This project was used as an instrument to understand the similar fundamentals of Node.js's package Express.js to Python's package Flask.

## Usage:

User site for creating posts and comments about other Data sites along with an URL.  Other users may make comments about existing post or upvote the post.  The dashboard also allows for users to make changes to any errors they may have entered during the original posting/comment.
